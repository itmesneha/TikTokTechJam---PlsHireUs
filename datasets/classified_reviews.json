She aggressively showed the house and handled everything including sending me documents to sign on my phone while I was on vacation. Ms. Lobaugh and her staff had to deal with a number of difficult legal situations and it was always professionally done. I would hire this company in a minute if I was selling my home. The firm is friendly but professional. Ms. Lobuagh and her staff responded immediately to all my questions and supportively walked me through the house's closing.

Due to their negligence and poor quality repairs I eventually had to replace the entire interior door panel to my truck (a costly claim to my insurance company).\\n\\nFirst, when they replaced the window the weather stripping was damaged, scratching the newly replaced glass/tint.\\n\\nI returned and requested they repair the weather stripping  - their solution was to bend the weather stripping back into place, instead of replacing it or repairing it correctly (leaving a large bend in the plastic).\\n\\nWhen I rolled the window down to test this repair, I realized the Roger\\u2019s Glass employee had somehow bent the interior door panel in their repairs, resulting in increased pressure on the window and causing it to pop off of its frame / motor and drop down into the interior of my door.\\n\\nSo I returned a third time to give them an opportunity to correct the issue.\\n\\nStaff insisted the failed repairs were due to a gluing issue and did not address the bent door panel and instead re-glued the window (applied a large amount of two-part epoxy to the window and window frame).  I described to them how I noticed the bent door panel was applying pressure to the window. The window motor made more noise because of the increased work to move the window up and down. Also, as the window rolled down it tilted inside the truck. The staff completely ignored my comments and these obvious signs of damage.\\n\\nAt this point, I did not feel confident in the shop\\u2019s ability to repair my truck and contacted my insurance company to submit a claim. The window and door panel were correctly repaired at local auto body shop.  With the door dismantled, I was able to see the interior of my door and my suspicions of poor repair were confirmed.\\nWith the damaged door panel replaced, the window now rolls down without tilting forward or the sounds of a struggling motor.\",\n  \"pics\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": [\n        \"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAY-dH00vOnkRMIqtzRYz9YjSshmx1KrHKqhrJ=w150-h150-k-no-p\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"resp\": null,\n  \"gmap_id\": \"0x56c8e0091b206d93:0xa5829f60d4ef3aa6\"\n}\n\n    Output only a JSON object like this:\n    {\n    \"label\": \"<one of the four categories>\",\n    \"rationale\": \"<brief 1-2 sentence explanation>\"\n    }\n     {\n    \"label\": \"Rant without visit\",\n    \"rationale\": \"User did not mention a visit to the business and expresses strong negative sentiment without providing evidence.\"\n    }"

They answered the phone promptly, the receptionist was more than helpful. They gave me a date that fit my schedule. John showed up and explained what he could do. I got a call from their office the next day with a quote. It was $10 more than the other company but the customer service here was so much better than the other company the choice was easy. A week later they called to say the glass was ready and offered to install the next day. I chose Monday instead. John returned and did a fabulous job even with the wind gusting pretty badly. Thank you for the great service.

Meanwhile, my daughter moved due to job opportunities elsewhere. Consequently, I then took over as Power of Attorney for her in the house sale. Jance Lobaugh was wonderful to deal with throughout the sale. I had problems requesting renters to move and she directed me to the right laws governing rental agreements. She aggressively showed the house and handled everything including sending me documents to sign on my phone while I was on vacation. Ms. Lobaugh and her staff had to deal with a number of difficult legal situations and it was always professionally done. I would hire this company in a minute if I was selling my home. The firm is friendly but professional. Ms. Lobuagh and her staff responded immediately to all my questions and supportively walked me through the house's closing. In addition, she dealt with both my daughter's lawyers and her ex-husband's attorney as well. Thank you.

Due to their negligence and poor quality repairs I eventually had to replace the entire interior door panel to my truck (a costly claim to my insurance company).\\n\\nFirst, when they replaced the window the weather stripping was damaged, scratching the newly replaced glass/tint.\\n\\nI returned and requested they repair the weather stripping  - their solution was to bend the weather stripping back into place, instead of replacing it or repairing it correctly (leaving a large bend in the plastic).\\n\\nWhen I rolled the window down to test this repair, I realized the Roger\\u2019s Glass employee had somehow bent the interior door panel in their repairs, resulting in increased pressure on the window and causing it to pop off of its frame / motor and drop down into the interior of my door.\\n\\nSo I returned a third time to give them an opportunity to correct the issue.\\n\\nStaff insisted the failed repairs were due to a gluing issue and did not address the bent door panel and instead re-glued the window (applied a large amount of two-part epoxy to the window and window frame).  I described to them how I noticed the bent door panel was applying pressure to the window. The window motor made more noise because of the increased work to move the window up and down. Also, as the window rolled down it tilted inside the truck. The staff completely ignored my comments and these obvious signs of damage.\\n\\nAt this point, I did not feel confident in the shop\\u2019s ability to repair my truck and contacted my insurance company to submit a claim. The window and door panel were correctly repaired at local auto body shop.  With the door dismantled, I was able to see the interior of my door and my suspicions of poor repair were confirmed.\\nWith the damaged door panel replaced, the window now rolls down without tilting forward or the sounds of a struggling motor.\",\n  \"pics\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": [\n        \"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAY-dH00vOnkRMIqtzRYz9YjSshmx1KrHKqhrJ=w150-h150-k-no-p\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"resp\": null,\n  \"gmap_id\": \"0x56c8e0091b206d93:0xa5829f60d4ef3aa6\"\n}\n\n    Output only a JSON object like this:\n    {\n    \"label\": \"<one of the four categories>\",\n    \"rationale\": \"<brief 1-2 sentence explanation>\"\n    }\n     {\n    \"label\": \"Rant without visit\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The reviewer describes extensive damage to the vehicle's interior door panel and window motor, which indicates they have not visited the business for the described service.\"\n    }"

I got a call from their office the next day with a quote. It was $10 more than the other company but the customer service here was so much better than the other company the choice was easy.
